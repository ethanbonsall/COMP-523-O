          The Pediatric Blue Book, or PBB, is a web application designed to transform how pediatric dietitians access and apply nutritional information. Currently, dietitians
          often must juggle outdated manuals, scattered online materials, and time-consuming manual calculations. PBB provides a streamlined, digital platform to help dietitians create precise and personalized nutrition 
          plans faster and easier. By reducing errors, managing inefficiencies, and supporting evidence-based decision making, the Pediatric Blue Book helps dietitians focus on giving children the best chance to grow, recover, and thrive.
